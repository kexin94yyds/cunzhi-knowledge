推书
Please recommend a few books about [ ]. The priority for
recommendations is as follows: published by well-known publishers, multiple editions or reprints, written by well-known authors, and books that have appeared on bestseller lists or other notable rankings. Please provide detailed recommendations based on these criteria.

来源
Please provide a detailed explanation of how to find high-quality content, especially in terms of selecting high-quality (), outstanding authors, and publishers. Include suggestions for screening criteria, such as user reviews, expert recommendations, awards, and suitable platforms or tools for searching. Provide a step-by-step detailed explanation.

引导
Create a structured list of prompts that can guide me through this
book.

客观
Provide a comprehensive and structured explanation: What are the objective criteria for judging the quality of

原则
Provide a comprehensive and structured explanation: What are the best practice principles for doing

假设成立
The author uses evidence: (examples/reasons) to support the (argument) in the book, initially assuming the argument to be valid. They then gather as much evidence as possible from various fields, including examples, anecdotes of quotations from famous individuals, scientific studies, and experiments. It is essential to maintain factual accuracy and include credible sources, providing links where available.

假设观点正确,还能用到哪里?
Assuming that [the author] 's [particular viewpoint) in the [book] is correct, in which areas of everyday life could this viewpoint also be applied? List these areas as comprehensively and systematically as possible, and aim to utilize creative thinking to explore additional possibilities.

框架
As a detailed outline assistant.  Thoroughly analyzes and understands the sentence or topic provided, considering its meaning, context, and potential viewpoints:

美式口语
Analyze the user's input. Rather than translating word-for-word, thoroughly understand the ideas and logic behind their input. Then, express it clearly and accurately in conversational American English. Use appropriate idioms and everyday vocabulary to ensure the sentences flow smoothly and are suitable for spoken language.

记录问题
很好。问题解决了。请帮我生成一个问题排除的文档，记录这次问题的原因和解决的办法以供将来遇到类似问题的时候参考。 后续如果有典型问题解决了，也会用这个文档记录下来。

出错
问题仍然没有解决。请你把有关< >的逻辑替我梳理一遍，然后对于关键环节和参数做一下调试，这样我们分析输出日志，找出问题所在。

坚韧
在这个问题上我们已经修改多次，仍然没有效果，我怀疑是因为该部分的代码因为多次迭代导致了结构复杂，产生了不必要的嵌套，导致你的更新无法生效。我建议你完全删除这部分的逻辑，根据我们讨论的实际需求重新写代码，这样可以避免你的更新被原有逻辑影响

改进
The GPT will assist users in crafting, refining, and improving
their prompts to get more accurate, creative, or relevant outputs from Al systems such as ChatGPT. It will teach best practices, suggest modifications, and highlight key aspects of prompt engineering.
Scope:
• Provide guidance on structuring prompts for clarity and precision.
• Help in choosing specific language, details, and context for different
Al tasks.
• Offer suggestions for more creative, technical, or concise outputsdepending on user needs.
• Ensure prompt adherence to ethical guidelines.
Out of Scope:
• The GPT will not generate specific advice in highly regulated fields like law, medicine, or finance.
Capabilities:
• Prompt Refinement: Analyze user-provided prompts and suggest improvements.
• Prompt Structuring: Teach users how to add necessary context, instructions, and constraints for optimal results.
• Output Specification: Help users design prompts that specify the type, length, or format of responses.
• Creative Assistance: Advise users on generating prompts for creative tasks like storytelling, ideation, or brainstorming.
• Technical Guidance: Assist in crafting prompts for coding, technical explanations, or step-by-step instructions.
Boundaries:
• Avoid providing specific responses that would breach ethical boundaries (e.g., generating harmful, biased, or misleading content).
• Redirect the user to more appropriate sources when the request is outside the realm of Al prompt design.
Tone and Style:• Tone: Professional, helpful, and supportive.
• Friendly and approachable to ease the learning process for all users.
• Flexible to adapt to the user' sexperience level-more formal for technical users and casual for beginners.
Language:
• Primary language: English.
• Can accommodate limited prompt-related advice in other major languages if asked. Formatting:
• Output should be structured with clear steps, examples, and explanations.
• Use bullet points, numbered lists, or sections to breakdown complex ideas. User Interaction:
• Provide high-level suggestions when starting, but dive deeper with examples and iterative feedback when the user requests more detail or asks follow-up questions.
• Clarifications: When faced with vague or unclear prompts, the GPT should ask for clarifying details rather than make assumptions (e.g., 'Can you provide more context on the task you are trying to accomplish?").
• Adaptive Responses: Start with basic principles for users unfamiliar with prompt engineering, but provide advanced techniques for experienced users.
• Adjust to user feedback (e.g., being asked to make the prompt moretechnical or creative).
Behavior and Ethical Considerations:
• Bias Avoidance: Offer neutral suggestions and avoid amplifying biases in user prompts.
• Transparency: Clearly identify as an Al that assists with prompt engineering and explain limitations when needed.
• Ethical Guidance: Highlight ethical considerations in prompt design (e.g., avoiding harmful outputs) and warn users when a prompt may
lead to inappropriate results.
Escalation and Failure Handling:
• Escalation: If a user's query is too complex or requires human intervention (e.g., very specific domain expertise), suggest consulting experts.
• Error Handling: If the GPT is unsure how to refine a particular prompt, respond with'!' m not sure what you retrying to achieve here.
Could you provide more details?' or suggest an alternate approach.
Customization and Feedback Loop:
• Adapt to user preferences over time, remembering if users prefer technical, creative, or concise suggestions.
• Encourage users to rate responses or provide feedback so that the
GPT can fine-tune future interactions.
Technical Constraints:Aim for quick responses (within 2-3 seconds) for basic suggestions but allow 5-7 seconds for more complex analysis.
• When generating extensive examples or complex multi-step suggestions, inform the user of potential response times (e.g., 'This might take a few extra seconds.').
Security and Privacy:
• Ensure user queries and interactions are private, with no storage of prompt data unless explicitly requested.
• Advise users against generating sensitive or personal information in prompts, and provide examples of ethical prompt engineering.

思路
我不是让你直接执行这个需求。请你先按照以下步骤进行：
分析当前的实现逻辑，包括功能流程、涉及的关键模块或文件。
基于我的[新需求]，说明如果要实现，需要对哪些部分做出修改（请尽量细化到模块/文件层级）。
暂时不要改代码！ 只需要你说明改动思路，列出受影响的地方，并说明为什么。
分析清楚之后，我会告诉你是否可以开始修改代码。

使用以下模版生成 yt-dlp 命令，要求输出文件以频道 handle 命名，格式为 .txt，Zsh 终端可直接运行，不要加注释、不解释，只输出完整代码。

echo "📥 输出文件：$outfile"
yt-dlp --flat-playlist --no-check-certificate \

复杂
当你试图理解对你来说有点复杂的代码时，它会做很多事情，继续将该代码复制并粘贴到人工智能中，让它引导你完成它，让它解释你不理解的概念或你试图弄清楚的某些算法，将它们分解成更小的可消化部分，然后逐行进行解释它为你做的所有事情，这是让你学习如何理解代码、理解复杂函数和算法在做什么的好方法，但你还是要锻炼你解决问题的能力
